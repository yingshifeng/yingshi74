  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>As an artist, I focus on exploring the relationship between human and nature. I am the person who enjoys nature and has inspired by environment a lot. But according to the time pass and human activities. Many issues come up, and our planet becomes worst. I am trying to address those problems in my work.
  <br>In the art piece "Our future," As more plastic is produced and discarded, this will affect oceanic pollution. I search the image of pollution of the sea，then put them together to make an island. Now is a small island, but if we do not stop this, it will become the whole world. In my other art piece "Ocean," I use this idea again and create a website, also combine the P5js technic as well. it can interact with the viewer. Compare to the “Our future”.I think it's a better way to push the idea, to remind people how human behavior impacts other life on this planet.

<p>Our group (Yingshi & Guoxun)concept is to make place series about environmental pollution. My
concept is to make about ocean pollution. As more plastic is produced and discarded, this will
affect oceanic pollution. I search the image about pollution of the sea，then put them together
to make an island. I name it“Our future”. Now is a small island, but if we not stop this, it will
become the whole world.</p>

We have always been moving forward, and it is easy to ignore the people and things behind us.
I make this video to remind people not to ignore the people around them.</p>

In this project, "Memory". we had created a web page inspired by our earlier internet memories.
It's a combination of earlier chatting environment we used and the classic pixel game. The style
we made is base on the experience at that time period. Such as the text, screen, button, sound
and border style. Also the thing with many "errors".</p>
